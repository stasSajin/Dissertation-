## LANGUAGE-VISION INTERACTIONS IN THE VISUAL WORLD PARADIGM: EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF DISPLAY AND WORKING MEMORY ##


**Objective**: the following report aims to provide a very high level overview for all five experiments in the dissertation. I'll generally try to do the following for each experiment:

	*Summarize the objective
	*Provide a brief description of the procedure
	*Cover briefly the results, mainly though visualizations
	*Summarize the novel contributions and knowledge
Note that more detailed info can be found in the dissertation document.

## Experiment 1 ##
#### Objective ####
Experiment 1 aims to test if phonological competition effects can be observed during the preview period in the VWP, when participants don't have to engage in auditory processing. In other words, if I give you the display with four words (see below) and I let you process it for about 1.9s (which is enough time to read all the words), will you start looking at the two words that are similar because they have some phonological/orthographic overlap? Or will you look at all four words with equal likelihood and only when the auditory signal is presented, your looks will start to converge to the target and competitor?

In the display above participants are presented with the Target=Bank, Competitor=band, Distractor=mist; Distractor=salt

If we find that participants look at target and competitor more, then this would be problematic for the linking hypothesis theory, since it posits that processing during visual preview plays no role in how fixations are being mapped. On the other hand, if we find each words gets about the same number of fixations over time, then we can conclude that spoken word processing drives competition effects in the VWP. 

#### Procedure ####
Experimental procedure was very simple. Participants were seated in front of a display. They wore headphones and their eye-movements were recorded. At the start of a trial, they were presented with a fixation cross at the center of the screen for about 1s. After that, the display switched to a display of four words and they were told to start looking immediately at the words on the screen. About 1.9s later they heard, the spoken target which referred to one of the words on the screen (e.g., "Click on bank"). Once they heard the spoken target, they had to use the mouse and select it. See the figure below for trial structure.

#### Results ####
Participants had to make responses for three types of trials. The focus will be mainly on Experimental trials.

The graph below shows the fixation proportions for all trial types (again, focus only on the Experimental trials).

Experimental trials essentially show that nothing is happening during the preview period. Once participants hear the auditory target, they start looking at the target and the matching competitor.
